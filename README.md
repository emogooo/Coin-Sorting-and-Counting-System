# Coin Sorting and Counting System

This project involves a system that uses an IR sensor and a DC motor to sort and count coins. The DC motor is used to create vibrations in a chamber. Coins dropped into this chamber move across an inclined surface due to the vibrations and enter a channel with holes corresponding to each coin's size. Each coin falls through its respective hole into a designated container. As the coins fall, an IR sensor is triggered, detecting and counting the coins as they enter the containers. The system can determine the quantity of each coin type and calculate the total monetary value.
